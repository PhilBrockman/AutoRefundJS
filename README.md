# AutoRefundJS

On my online sameday shopping, I take a gamble: my items may be out of stock. I don't want to manually choose replacements or get surprised by the system's "best available" choices?

AutoRefundJS to the rescue! It automates the refunding process for all out-of-stock items, I can relax knowing you won't end up with a random replacement that you didn't want.

Before we go any further, though, here's the small print:
